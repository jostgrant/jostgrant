#  JOSHUA STEVEN GRANT (JOSTGRANT)
### DESCRIPTION

Hey fellers & fellas, Grant here & welcome to my Github! The scope of this account has changed a lot during the past year or-so -- like many, the events of the 2020 - 2021(+ ?) COVID-19 Pandemic has caused me to [reevaluate my life](https://jostgrant.github.io/foreword-on-moving-forwards/) in some nontrivial ways. This profile has become the manifestation of that lingering affect by working towards **actually** being 'effective' in the world over any moralizing, pleasure-seeking, and/or pain avoidance that I've so readily fallen into. So the "goal" for this space, between now and 2023 / 2024, is to build some kind of project portfolio in-line with this ethos.

### INTERESTS
 Edutainment, Interactive Programming, Compiler Development, Game-Engine Architecture, Technical Writing, And AR/VR Interfaces. 

### ROADMAP

All-in on [Go](https://go.dev/) for the second-half of 2022; Basically treat it like I'm a absolute beginner / completely re-learning how to program -- then start cranking out projects. Once I feel "comfortable enough" in the ecosystem then really commit to [Rune-Struct](https://github.com/rune-struct/).

### STATUS
#### [2022-07-11] Just Go-Ing For It.
- Commit to GoLang till at least the end of the year.
   - Effectively going to treat it as-if I, was starting from scratch / am "a beginner".
   - In-tandem my short-term goal is to just really start cranking out projects.
     - (Like want to get back to writing code everyday... it's been years.)
   - Have a few places I want to go from there, but going to leave it pretty loose for now.
   - But yeah, I'm pretty sure that this is the most viable way "[foreword](https://jostgrant.github.io/foreword-on-moving-forwards/)" for me at this point.
